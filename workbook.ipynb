They are actually considered \"magic\" attributes that you should only use when documentation tells you to.  `__repr__` is one of the only examples that you are likely to see and use relatively often (the other being `__init__`).  A `repr` method in a python class is actually how you tell python how to print your class.

This sounds kind of weird, but we are basically saying that everyone is a person that has some set of attributes (in this case a first name, last name, and maybe a nickname).  If a person is a student, we then create a row for them in the student table, but we don't want to put in their names again, so we just say \"hey, this student is also a person, just look here to get the 'person' information.\"  We will see this kind of relationship all over the place."
