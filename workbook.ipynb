It is a nice package for interacting with any SQL database and allows us to create classes in python, and then it translates those classes into SQL statements for the database.

They are actually considered \"magic\" attributes that you should only use when documentation tells you to.  `__repr__` is one of the only examples that you are likely to see and use relatively often (the other being `__init__`).  A `repr` method in a python class is actually how you tell python how to print your class.
