    "\n",
    "`version: '3.9'` is telling docker what version of docker-compose we are using, it doesn't actually have anything to do with postgres yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "`services:    db:` is just telling docker that we are going to be creating a service which we are going to name `db`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`image: postgres` tells docker that image that we want to use.  Since you likely don't have the `postgres` image downloaded yet, the first time you start up your database docker will download the actual image for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "`restart: always` lets docker know to restart the database if it ever crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`environment:    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example` sets the password for your database to `example` (not the most secure password, I know).\n",
    "\n",
    "`volumes:      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` is mapping the local folder `db-data` to the folder `/var/lib/postgresql/data` inside your docker container.  This lets you persist your data when you shut down you database a little easier as everything will always be saved in that local folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ports:      - 5433:5432` is a mapping of ports.  It is mapping the internal port of 5432 (the postgres default port) to the localhost port of 5433.  You can set this port to something else if you want, or even to 5432 if you don't have postgres already installed on your computer.  Just make sure you remember what port you pick later.\n",
    "\n",
    "`volumes:    db-data:` tells docker that we want to use some local volumes in our container.  Note that this is the same name we used a few lines above when we were connecting a local directory to the data directory inside docker"
